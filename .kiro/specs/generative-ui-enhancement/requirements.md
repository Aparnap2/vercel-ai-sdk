# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the TechTrend Support Chatbot to implement Vercel AI SDK 3.0's Generative UI capabilities with React Server Components. The enhancement focuses on creating a production-grade customer support system that securely queries user-specific data and renders rich, interactive UI components directly from the LLM responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure User Data Access

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the chatbot to only access my personal data when I provide my email address, so that my privacy is protected and I only see information relevant to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides their email address THEN the system SHALL validate the email format before processing
2. WHEN querying the database THEN the system SHALL only return data associated with the authenticated user's email
3. WHEN no email is provided THEN the system SHALL NOT return any customer-specific data
4. IF an invalid email format is provided THEN the system SHALL return an error message with guidance
5. WHEN multiple users are chatting THEN the system SHALL ensure data isolation between sessions

### Requirement 2: Generative UI Implementation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see my data displayed in rich, interactive components instead of plain text, so that I can easily understand and interact with the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM responds with customer data THEN the system SHALL render appropriate UI components using React Server Components
2. WHEN displaying user information THEN the system SHALL use the UserCard component with streaming capabilities
3. WHEN showing product data THEN the system SHALL render ProductCard components with real-time information
4. WHEN presenting order history THEN the system SHALL display OrderCard components with interactive elements
5. WHEN showing support tickets THEN the system SHALL render TicketCard components with status updates
6. WHEN multiple data types are returned THEN the system SHALL render multiple component types in a single response

### Requirement 3: Production-Grade Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbot to implement proper security measures, so that customer data is protected and the system is resistant to attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs
2. WHEN querying the database THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL NOT expose sensitive system information
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL exclude personally identifiable information from logs
5. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Database Tool Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database tool to be optimized for user-specific queries, so that the system performs efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database tool is called THEN it SHALL require an email parameter for customer-specific queries
2. WHEN no email is provided THEN the tool SHALL return an error instead of all data
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use filtered fallback data based on the user's email
4. WHEN multiple queries are needed THEN the system SHALL batch them efficiently
5. WHEN query results are empty THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance to the user

### Requirement 5: React Server Components Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to load quickly and be interactive, so that I can efficiently get the support I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL use React Server Components for optimal performance
2. WHEN data is streaming THEN the UI SHALL show progressive loading states
3. WHEN components are interactive THEN they SHALL maintain client-side functionality where needed
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error components
5. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL minimize client-side JavaScript bundle size

### Requirement 6: Multi-Format Data Display

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see different types of my data (tickets, products, orders, user info) in a consistent but contextually appropriate format, so that I can easily understand all information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying mixed data types THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling across all card components
2. WHEN rendering user data THEN it SHALL show contact information, preferences, and account status
3. WHEN showing product information THEN it SHALL display availability, pricing, and specifications
4. WHEN presenting order data THEN it SHALL include status, tracking, and product details
5. WHEN displaying support tickets THEN it SHALL show issue description, status, and resolution timeline
6. WHEN multiple cards are shown THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical, scannable layout

### Requirement 7: Streaming and Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see information appear progressively as it's being processed, so that I know the system is working and don't have to wait for everything to load at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM is processing THEN the system SHALL show streaming text responses
2. WHEN components are being generated THEN the system SHALL display loading states
3. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show progressive updates
4. WHEN errors occur during streaming THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
5. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL indicate completion to the user

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the system to work reliably even when there are technical issues, so that I can still get basic support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use mock data filtered by user email
2. WHEN the AI service fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback response
3. WHEN component rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display the data in a basic format
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN all systems fail THEN the system SHALL provide contact information for human support
